For this project I was able to practice using the JavaScript fetch method to fetch data from an open source API and using the data
gathered from the fetch method to display new random users everytime the page reloads. This project required knowledge of HTTP requests,
promises, event listeners, and DOM manipulation. 

I've added some extra features to this project that includes new backgorund colors to each card element as well as a new background color
on the cards when moused over. 

I've also implemented a search feature, and to do this I had to update my fetch API request to only 
include user nationalities that were in the english alphabet so that I could filter the list of users when search. The search feature
includes an input field that listens for the submit event and updates the list of users accordingly. 

I've also added a feature to click
the modals without having to close the current modal allowing you to flip through them.
